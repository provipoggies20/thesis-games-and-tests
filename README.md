Contents of our Final Thesis as a Game Developer. A various games and tests particularly to compare RNGs. 
So the overall focus of our thesis is to compare, differentiate, and understand the two (2) types of RNGs in C++; we picked Pseudo's rand() and Uniform's unifom_int_dist().

We created our first three games named Dise which differentiate on how they produce randomness using GDScript's RNG, Pseudo, and Uniform.
Next is we created a game based on Genshin Impact's Gacha System using the two "said" RNGs and combined them into 1 single code while still maintaining their original syntax.
and Lastlly We tests the two RNGs by Speed, Efficiency, and Predictability.
